SQL statements from my presentation at QGIS North America 2020 on July 31, 2020 entitled "QGIS and PostgreSQL/PostGIS as an enterprise solution: 5 features everyone should use"

Abstract
QGIS, a feature-rich desktop GIS, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS, a robust spatially-enabled RDBMS, are the fundamental components of an open source enterprise GIS. Combined, these two solutions offer countless functions and capabilities. This presentation will highlight 5 essential features that everyone should use in an enterprise environment, namely (1) user management, (2) trigger functions, (3) default styling, (4) form data input, and (5) saving maps in the database.
